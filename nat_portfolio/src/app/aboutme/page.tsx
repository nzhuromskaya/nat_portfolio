          Hi there! My name is Nataliya Zhuromskaya. I am a full stack software
          engineer from Omaha, Nebraska. I have lived here for over a decade,
          but I am originally from Belarus.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am interested in all things creative, which is why I like front end
          development. I like to draw, write, play guitar, and I like weaving
          chainmail pieces.
